In the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 match against Afghanistan national cricket team, Glenn Maxwell played one of the greatest ODI innings ever, scoring an unbeaten 201 runs off 128 balls while battling severe cramps and hardly able to run. Chasing 292, Australia collapsed to 91/7, but Maxwell single-handedly turned the game around with extraordinary power-hitting and resilience, smashing boundaries almost entirely through timing and brute force. His historic double century—the first ever in a World Cup chase—led Australia to an incredible victory and is widely regarded as one of the most remarkable innings in cricket history.
